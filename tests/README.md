# Tests

Many of the tests are taken verbatim from the [csoundAPI_examples](https://github.com/csound/csoundAPI_examples) site and are slightly adjusted to accommodate the slightly different style of `csnd`, which amounts to using python style `snake_case` for methods but otherwise following the design language of `ctcsound.py` as much as possible.

The test `__doc__` in each case is taken directly from these examples.

All of the rights and credits are reserved to the original authors throughout: Steven Yi, Victor Lazarrini, and Fran√ßois Pinot, et al. whose contributions made this project possible.
